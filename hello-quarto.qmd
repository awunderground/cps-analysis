## Quarto {#sec-quarto}

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

I used to live in `r params$state`.

```{r}
toupper(params$state)

```

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (y - \hat{y})^2}
$$ {#eq-rmse}

```{r}
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)



```

On average, a one unit increase in speed is associated with a `r coef(model)[["speed"]]` increase in stopping distance.

@sec-quarto introduces Quarto.

@eq-rmse is a very, very important equation.

Tidy data is an important idea in data science [@wickham2014].

@wickham2014 introduce the idea of tidy data.
